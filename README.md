# Off-by-One Error in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Dart and its solution.

The `bug.dart` file contains code with an index out-of-bounds error in a for loop. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides the corrected code.

This error is subtle but can lead to runtime exceptions.  The solution highlights the importance of carefully managing loop indices when accessing elements in lists or arrays.
